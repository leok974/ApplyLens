# ThreadViewer Roadmap: ApplyLens Console v1

**Status:** ✅ Phases 1–5 Complete
**Branch:** `thread-viewer-v1`
**Target:** Production-ready operator console for email triage and security review

---

## Vision

Build a unified **ThreadViewer** component that gives ApplyLens operators (recruiters, security reviewers, admins) a **10-second comprehension** of any email thread with **fast, safe triage actions**.

### Key Principles

1. **Context First**: AI summary + timeline before full content
2. **Safety by Default**: Risk analysis, rollback, partial success handling
3. **Power User Optimized**: Keyboard shortcuts, bulk actions, auto-advance
4. **Feedback Loop**: Analytics + user feedback for continuous improvement
5. **Mobile-First**: Responsive drawer that works on all devices

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (✅ Complete)

- ✅ Recommended action (Quarantine, Mark Safe, etc.)
- ✅ Loading and error states for async analysis

### Technical
- `ThreadRiskAnalysis` type definition
- `fetchThreadAnalysis()` with fallback mock data
- Color-coded visual hierarchy
- Integration with backend security API (or mock)

---

## Phase 3: Navigation & Keyboard (✅ Complete)

**Goal:** Enable power users to fly through inbox

### Features
- ✅ Previous/Next navigation between threads
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts:
  - `ArrowUp` / `ArrowDown` — navigate
  - `D` — mark done / archive
  - `Escape` — close drawer
- ✅ Progress tracking (X of Y items)
- ✅ Disabled states when at boundaries

### Technical
- `useThreadViewer` hook with `items[]` array
- Index-based navigation
- Keyboard event handlers with proper focus management
- Integration with parent page state

---

## Phase 4: Bulk Triage & Auto-Advance (✅ Complete)

**Goal:** Triaging 100 emails should take minutes, not hours

### Features

#### 4.1: Bulk Selection & Actions
- ✅ Checkboxes for multi-select
- ✅ Bulk action buttons:
  - Archive X selected
  - Mark Safe (X)
  - Quarantine X
- ✅ Conditional UI (bulk buttons vs single-action buttons)
- ✅ Progress counter shows "X of Y handled"

#### 4.2: Auto-Advance Toggle
- ✅ "Auto-advance after action" checkbox
- ✅ Automatically moves to next item after Archive/Quarantine/Mark Safe
- ✅ Persisted user preference in hook state
- ✅ Works with both single and bulk actions

#### 4.3: Backend Integration
- ✅ 3 new bulk endpoints in `inbox_actions.py`:
  - `/api/actions/bulk/archive`
  - `/api/actions/bulk/mark-safe`
  - `/api/actions/bulk/quarantine`
- ✅ Frontend API helpers in `api.ts`
- ✅ Optimistic updates with rollback

#### 4.4: User Feedback & Safety
- ✅ Toast notifications (Sonner library)
- ✅ Success toasts with emoji icons (📥, ✅, 🔒)
- ✅ Error toasts with descriptions
- ✅ Rollback on API failure
- ✅ Loading states ("Processing...") during mutations
- ✅ Buttons disabled during API calls

#### 4.5: Partial Success Handling
- ✅ Backend returns `{updated: [], failed: []}`
- ✅ Three-tier response handling:
  - Complete success (0 failed) → green toast
  - Partial success (some failed) → yellow warning toast "58/60"
  - Complete failure (all failed) → red error toast
- ✅ **Surgical rollback**: only failed IDs reverted
- ✅ User sees exactly what succeeded and what failed

#### 4.6: Undo Functionality
- ✅ "Undo" button in success toasts
- ✅ Restores original state for affected threads
- ✅ Confirmation toast: "↩️ Undone"
- ✅ Works by referencing pre-mutation snapshot

#### 4.7: Analytics & Telemetry
- ✅ `analytics.ts` utility with type-safe event tracking
- ✅ Tracked events:
  - `bulk_action` (action type, count)
  - `bulk_action_undo` (action type, count)
  - `auto_advance_toggle` (enabled boolean)
- ✅ Console logging in dev, ready for production analytics providers
- ✅ Fail-silent design (never breaks user flow)

### Technical Highlights
- Optimistic UI updates for instant feedback
- Robust error handling with surgical rollback
- Type-safe bulk action responses
- Integration with parent page state management
- React hooks: `useState`, `useCallback` for performance

---

## Phase 5: Timeline + Rolling Summary + Feedback (✅ Complete)

**Goal:** 10-second comprehension without scrolling full thread

### Features

#### 5.1: AI-Generated Summary
- ✅ `ThreadSummarySection` component
- ✅ Headline: short TL;DR of conversation
- ✅ Details: bullet points with context, next steps, asks
- ✅ Positioned between Risk Analysis and message body
- ✅ Fallback mock data if backend doesn't provide summary

#### 5.2: Timeline of Events
- ✅ `ConversationTimelineSection` component
- ✅ Chronological list of key events:
  - received, replied, follow_up_needed, flagged, status_change
- ✅ Each event shows:
  - Actor (sender/system)
  - Timestamp
  - Human-readable note
  - Color-coded badge by event kind
- ✅ Fallback mock data if backend doesn't provide timeline

#### 5.3: User Feedback Control
- ✅ "Helpful? Yes / No" buttons in Summary section
- ✅ Local state only (no persistence yet)
- ✅ Acknowledgment messages:
  - "Thanks!" (Yes)
  - "Got it — we'll improve this." (No)
- ✅ Hidden on mobile, visible on desktop

#### 5.4: Type Extensions
- ✅ New types in `thread.ts`:
  - `ThreadSummary` (headline, details[])
  - `ThreadTimelineEvent` (ts, actor, kind, note)
- ✅ Extended `ThreadData` and `MessageDetail` types
- ✅ Comprehensive TODO comments for future backend integration

### UX Flow
```
1. User opens thread
2. Sees Risk Analysis (security verdict)
3. Sees Summary (what's happening, next steps)
4. Sees Timeline (who did what when)
5. Scrolls to full message only if needed
6. Takes action with full context
```

### Technical Highlights
- Conditional rendering (returns `null` if no data)
- Fallback data generation in `fetchThreadDetail()`
- Visual consistency with existing sections
- Dark mode support with proper color schemes
- Responsive design (feedback buttons adapt to viewport)

---

## Future Phases (Roadmap)

### Phase 6: Backend Integration
- **Summary Generation**: Wire to LLM API for real-time summaries
- **Timeline Extraction**: Parse email headers/metadata for events
- **Feedback Persistence**: POST feedback to `/api/feedback/summary`
- **Model Training**: Use feedback signals to improve summaries

### Phase 7: Advanced Features
- **Thread Grouping**: Collapse related emails into single summary
- **Intent Detection**: Label timeline events with AI-detected intents
- **Smart Filters**: Filter timeline by event kind
- **Quick Actions**: Inline reply, forward, schedule from drawer
- **Attachments**: Preview PDFs, images inline

### Phase 8: Collaboration
- **Shared Notes**: Team members can add context to threads
- **Assignment**: Assign threads to specific reviewers
- **Status Tracking**: "In Review", "Escalated", "Resolved"
- **Audit Log**: Full history of who did what when

### Phase 9: Intelligence
- **Pattern Detection**: "This looks like 5 other threads from this sender"
- **Anomaly Alerts**: "Unusual time of day / domain / language"
- **Batch Insights**: "You quarantined 50 emails today, 12 from same domain"
- **Trending Threats**: Dashboard of emerging phishing campaigns

---

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1-5 Goals ✅

## Architecture Overview

### Component Hierarchy
```
Pages (Inbox, Search, InboxWithActions)
  └─ useThreadViewer hook (state management)
      └─ ThreadViewer (drawer component)
          ├─ Header (subject, close button)
          ├─ StatusChips (quarantined, archived)
          ├─ RiskAnalysisSection (Phase 2)
          ├─ ThreadSummarySection (Phase 5)
          ├─ ConversationTimelineSection (Phase 5)
          ├─ Message Body (HTML/text)
          └─ ThreadActionBar (Phase 4)
              ├─ Single Actions (Mark Safe, Quarantine, Archive)
              └─ Bulk Actions (Archive X, Mark Safe X, Quarantine X)
```

### Data Flow
```
1. Parent page maintains items[] array
2. useThreadViewer hook manages:
   - Selection state (selectedBulkIds)
   - Auto-advance preference
   - Navigation (prev/next)
   - Bulk actions with optimistic updates
3. ThreadViewer fetches:
   - Thread detail (fetchThreadDetail)
   - Risk analysis (fetchThreadAnalysis)
4. Backend returns:
   - Full thread data + summary + timeline
   - Risk analysis + recommended action
   - Bulk action results (updated[], failed[])
5. UI updates optimistically, rolls back on error
```

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/actions/message/:id` — fetch thread detail
- `GET /api/security/analyze/:id` — fetch risk analysis
- `POST /api/actions/bulk/archive` — bulk archive
- `POST /api/actions/bulk/mark-safe` — bulk mark safe
- `POST /api/actions/bulk/quarantine` — bulk quarantine

---

## Testing Strategy

### Test Plans
- ✅ `TEST_PLAN_THREAD_VIEWER_PHASE_4.md` — Bulk actions, undo, analytics
- ✅ `TEST_PLAN_THREAD_VIEWER_PHASE_5.md` — Summary, timeline, feedback

### Coverage Areas
1. **Functional**: All features work as specified

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well ✅
- **Incremental approach**: 5 phases allowed for testing at each step
- **Type safety**: TypeScript caught errors early
- **Fallback data**: UI never breaks even if backend isn't ready
- **Optimistic updates**: Instant feedback feels fast
- **Surgical rollback**: Partial success handled gracefully

### What We'd Do Differently 🔄
- **Earlier analytics planning**: Would define tracking schema in Phase 1
- **More granular types**: Could separate `MessageDetail` vs `ThreadDetail`
- **Component testing**: Would add unit tests alongside features
- **Accessibility audit**: Should test with screen readers from Phase 1

### Key Technical Decisions 📋
- **Sonner for toasts**: Lightweight, beautiful, easy to use
- **Optimistic UI**: Better UX than waiting for server confirmation
- **Hook-based state**: Easier to test and reuse than Redux
- **Fallback mock data**: Unblocks frontend while backend is in progress
- **No persistence for feedback yet**: Iterate on UX before backend complexity
