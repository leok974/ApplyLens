## Completed PRs

### ✅ PR1: Policy Registry, Versioning & CRUD API
**Commit**: 2b8f5c3  
**Lines**: 983  
**Files**: 6

**Deliverables**:
- `PolicyBundle` SQLAlchemy model with semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- JSON Schema Draft 7 for rule validation (9 actions, 3 effects, 6 operators)

### ✅ PR2: Policy Linter & Validator
**Commit**: c205443  
**Lines**: 763  
**Files**: 4

**Deliverables**:
- `app/policy/lint.py`: Static analysis engine with 7 checks
- `app/routers/policy_lint.py`: POST /policy/lint endpoint
- 20 comprehensive tests (15 unit + 5 API)

**7 Lint Checks**:
1. **Duplicate IDs**: Detects same rule ID multiple times
2. **Missing Reasons**: Ensures all rules have explanations (≥10 chars)
3. **Conflicts**: Finds allow/deny conflicts for same agent+action
4. **Unreachable Rules**: Detects rules shadowed by higher-priority catch-alls
5. **Budget Sanity**: Ensures needs_approval rules have budget info
6. **Invalid Conditions**: Validates operator syntax (>=, <=, >, <, ==, !=)
7. **Disabled Rules**: Reports disabled rules as info-level

**Output**:
- Severity levels: error, warning, info
- Actionable suggestions for fixes
- Line numbers for precise location
- Pass/fail summary

---

### ✅ PR3: Simulation Engine (What-If Analysis)
**Commit**: adc5d4c  
**Lines**: 1,112  
**Files**: 4

**Deliverables**:
- `app/policy/sim.py`: Rule matching and simulation engine
- `app/routers/policy_sim.py`: 3 REST endpoints
- 35 comprehensive tests (5 test classes)

**Simulation Engine**:
- **Rule Matching**: Operator evaluation (>=, <=, >, <, ==, !=)
- **Priority Sorting**: Higher priority rules evaluated first
- **Effect Tracking**: Allow/deny/approval/no-match counts
- **Budget Calculation**: Accumulates cost and compute
- **Breach Detection**: Flags budget overruns (cost >$1000, compute >100)

**Test Datasets**:
1. **Fixtures**: 9 curated edge cases
   - High-risk inbox (new domain, known domain, low risk)
   - Knowledge reindex (full 100GB, small 1GB)
   - Planner deploys (canary, rollback)
   - Edge cases (missing fields, extreme values)
2. **Synthetic**: AI-generated (100-1000 cases, seeded for reproducibility)
3. **Custom**: User-provided test data

**3 Endpoints**:
- POST /policy/simulate: Run simulation with dataset choice
- GET /policy/simulate/fixtures: Return curated test cases
- POST /policy/simulate/compare: Side-by-side bundle comparison with deltas

---

### ✅ PR5: Import/Export & Signing
**Commit**: ab98a45  
**Lines**: 794  
**Files**: 4

**Deliverables**:
- `app/utils/signing.py`: HMAC-SHA256 signing utilities (reused from Phase 4)
- `app/routers/policy_bundle_io.py`: 3 REST endpoints
- 20 comprehensive tests (9 signing + 4 export + 7 import)

**Security**:
- **HMAC-SHA256**: Cryptographic signatures for bundles
- **Time-Limited**: Configurable expiry (default 24h) prevents replay
- **Constant-Time**: `hmac.compare_digest()` prevents timing attacks
- **Provenance**: Tracks source="imported", stores signature

**3 Endpoints**:
- GET /policy/bundles/{id}/export: Sign bundle with expiry
- POST /policy/bundles/import: Verify signature, create as draft
- GET /policy/bundles/{id}/export/download: JSON file download

**Import Safeguards**:
- Signature verification before import
- Expiry validation (reject expired bundles)
- Version uniqueness checks (409 on duplicate)
- Creates as draft (active=False) for review
- Stores audit trail in database

---

### ✅ PR6: Apply/Activate with Canary & Rollback
**Commit**: 4b00e96  
**Lines**: 1,298  
**Files**: 4

**Deliverables**:
- `app/policy/activate.py`: Activation engine with quality gates
- `app/routers/policy_activate.py`: 5 REST endpoints
- 30 comprehensive tests (5 test classes)

**Activation Logic**:
- **activate_bundle()**: Requires approval, starts at 10% canary
- **check_canary_gates()**: Quality monitoring with 4 thresholds
- **promote_canary()**: Gradual rollout (10% → 50% → 100%)
- **rollback_bundle()**: Emergency revert to previous version
- **get_canary_status()**: Monitoring endpoint for dashboards

**Quality Gates** (all must pass for promotion):
1. Error rate < 5%
2. Deny rate < 30%
3. Cost increase < 20%
4. Minimum 100 decisions sample size

**Canary Workflow**:
```
Day 0 (0h):   Activate at 10% (requires approval)
              ↓ Monitor quality gates
Day 1 (24h):  ✅ Gates pass → Promote to 50%
              ↓ Monitor for another 24h
Day 2 (48h):  ✅ Gates pass → Promote to 100%
```

**Rollback Features**:
- Deactivates current bundle immediately
- Reactivates previous version at 100%
- Creates HIGH severity incident (Phase 5.4 integration)
- Records rollback metadata (reason, timestamp, user)
- Auto-rollback on critical failures (error >10%, deny >50%, cost +50%)

**5 Endpoints**:
- POST /policy/bundles/{id}/activate: Activate with approval gate
- POST /policy/bundles/{id}/check-gates: Quality monitoring
- POST /policy/bundles/{id}/promote: Canary progression
- POST /policy/bundles/{id}/rollback: Emergency revert
- GET /policy/bundles/{id}/canary-status: Monitoring endpoint

#### POLICY_RECIPES.md (17 Patterns)

**Inbox Triage** (3 recipes):
- Quarantine high-risk emails (risk_score ≥ 85)
- Escalate medium-risk for manual review (60-85)
- Whitelist trusted senders (@company.com, DKIM verified)

**Knowledge Management** (3 recipes):
- Auto-approve small reindex (<10GB, <$5)
- Require approval for large operations (>50GB, >$25)
- Block hard deletes in production (prevent data loss)

**Deployment Safety** (3 recipes):
- Require canary for all production deploys
- Allow emergency rollbacks without approval
- Block off-hours deploys (outside 8am-6pm)

**Budget Controls** (2 recipes):
- Cost thresholds (approval for operations >$100)
- Compute limits with load awareness (block when load >80%)

**Business Hours** (1 recipe):
- Defer low-priority to weekdays (preserve weekend capacity)

**Risk-Based** (1 recipe):
- High-risk requires two approvers (prevent single-person mistakes)

**Category Exceptions** (2 recipes):
- Newsletter auto-archive (reduce inbox clutter)
- VIP bypass (never quarantine VIP senders)

**Advanced** (2 recipes):
- Progressive rollout (gradually lower thresholds: 90→85→80)
- Circuit breaker (auto-disable on 10% error rate)

#### RUNBOOK_POLICY.md Procedures

**Emergency Procedures**:
- EMERGENCY: Policy causing production impact (MTTR: <5 min)
  * Step-by-step commands for immediate rollback
  * Verification and communication steps
- EMERGENCY: Rollback not working (immediate escalation)
  * Bypass policy system entirely
  * Manual database failover
  * Incident bridge setup

**Rollback Procedures**:
- Standard rollback (non-emergency)
  * Impact assessment
  * Ticket creation
  * Execution and verification
  * Post-mortem requirements
- Auto-rollback scenarios
  * Triggers: error >10%, deny >50%, cost +50%
  * Actions: immediate rollback + incident creation
  * Response checklist

**Incident Response**:
- Policy-related incident mapping (Phase 5.4 integration)
- Incident-triggered rollback flow (decision matrix by age/error rate)
- Response checklist for on-call engineers

**Version Management**:
- Semantic versioning guidelines (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH examples)
- Version lifecycle (Draft → Canary 10% → Canary 50% → Active 100%)
- Version hygiene best practices (DO/DON'T lists)

**Monitoring & Alerts**:
- Key metrics dashboard (Grafana panels)
- Critical alerts (PagerDuty): Error rate high, rollback failed
- Warning alerts (Slack): Canary gate failing, budget high
- Notification format and channel routing

**Troubleshooting**:
- Canary won't promote (insufficient samples, gates failing)
- Policy not taking effect (activation, canary %, priority issues)
- Import failed (signature expired, version conflict)

**Post-Mortem**:
- When to write (required vs optional scenarios)
- Template with timeline, impact, root cause, action items
- Review meeting agenda (30 min format)
- Escalation path and team contacts

## Skipped PRs

### ⏸️ PR4: Web UI - Policy Editor + Sandbox
**Status**: Not Started  
**Reason**: Deferred to focus on backend completion

**Planned Components** (for future implementation):
- PolicyStudio.tsx: Main policy editor page
- RuleBuilder.tsx: Visual rule creation UI
- LintPanel.tsx: Real-time validation with inline annotations
- SimPanel.tsx: What-if simulator with dataset selection
- DiffViewer.tsx: Side-by-side version comparison
- Playwright tests for E2E workflows

**Rationale for Deferral**:
- Backend APIs are fully functional and tested
- UI can be implemented independently without blocking backend
- Large scope (~2000-3000 lines) warrants separate focused implementation
- REST APIs provide programmatic access for immediate use

---

## Technical Architecture

## Integration Points

### Phase 5.4 Interventions
- **Incident Creation**: Rollbacks create HIGH severity incidents
- **Incident Trigger**: Active incidents can trigger policy rollbacks
- **SSE Notifications**: Policy changes broadcast to incident dashboard

### Phase 4 Approvals
- **Activation Gate**: `activate_bundle()` requires approval_id
- **Approval Metadata**: Stores approval_id in policy_bundles table
- **HMAC Signing**: Reuses Phase 4 signing utilities for import/export

### Phase 5.1 Telemetry
- **Decision Logging**: Policy decisions logged to telemetry
- **Metrics Collection**: Quality gates read from telemetry metrics
- **Budget Tracking**: Cost/compute aggregated from telemetry
