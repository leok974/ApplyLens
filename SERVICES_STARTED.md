# Services Started Successfully! ✅

## Current Status

All ApplyLens services are now running:

```
✅ applylens-db-prod          (PostgreSQL 16)
✅ applylens-es-prod          (Elasticsearch 8.13)
✅ applylens-redis-prod       (Redis)
✅ applylens-api-prod         (FastAPI v0.4.20)
✅ applylens-web-prod         (React v0.4.21)
✅ applylens-nginx-prod       (Nginx reverse proxy)
✅ applylens-kibana-prod      (Data visualization)
✅ applylens-grafana-prod     (Monitoring)
✅ applylens-prometheus-prod  (Metrics)
```

## Access Points

- **Web Application**: http://localhost (via Nginx)
- **API**: http://localhost:8003
- **Kibana**: http://localhost:5601
- **Grafana**: http://localhost:3000
- **Prometheus**: http://localhost:9090

## Running E2E Tests

### Important Note

The E2E tests work best against the **development server**, not the production Docker setup. The production Nginx configuration has routing (e.g., `/search` → `/web/search`) that interferes with Playwright's expectations.

### Recommended: Test Against Dev Server

1. **Keep backend services running** (they're already started):
   ```bash
   docker ps  # Verify services are up
   ```

2. **Start the dev server**:
   ```bash
   cd d:\ApplyLens\apps\web
   npm run dev
   ```

   Wait for: `➜ Local: http://localhost:5175/`

3. **Run the tests**:
   ```bash
   # In a new terminal
   cd d:\ApplyLens\apps\web
   npm run test:e2e -- e2e/search-derived-and-tooltip --reporter=list
   ```

### Expected Test Results

The test suite for v0.4.21 UX polish features includes:

1. ✅ **Derived Subject Detection** - Verifies emails with missing subjects show derived text from body
2. ✅ **Results Header** - Confirms header displays result count and query
3. ✅ **Tooltip on Hover** - Validates scoring pill shows tooltip on mouse hover
4. ✅ **Tooltip on Focus** - Ensures keyboard accessibility (A11y compliance)

One test may skip if all emails in your dataset have subjects (this is graceful - not a failure).

## Test Hooks Added (v0.4.21)

Safe-for-production test IDs:
- `data-testid="result-subject"` - Email subject elements
- `data-testid="results-header"` - Search results header
- `data-testid="scoring-pill"` - Scoring information badge
- `data-derived="0|1"` - Flag indicating if subject was derived

## Stopping Services

When you're done:

```bash
# Stop all services
cd d:\ApplyLens
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down

# Or stop just the web/API while keeping data services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml stop api web nginx
```

## Next Steps

1. Start the dev server (see above)
2. Run the test suite
3. Expected: 3-4 passing tests (1 may skip gracefully)
4. If tests pass, you're ready to deploy the test hooks to production

- Test hooks specification: See files modified in v0.4.21
- Testing guide: `docs/TESTING.md` (to be created)

**Status**: ✅ All services healthy and ready for testing
**Next Action**: Start dev server and run E2E tests
