.SYNOPSIS
    Test the "Always do this" feature end-to-end

.DESCRIPTION
    This script tests the complete flow:
    1. Proposes actions for sample emails
    2. Views pending actions in tray
    3. Creates a learned policy via /always endpoint
    4. Verifies policy was created
    5. Checks Prometheus metrics
