.SYNOPSIS
    Create a test policy that matches all emails (for demo/testing)

.DESCRIPTION
    Creates a simple policy that will match all emails in the database,
    allowing you to test the "Always do this" feature immediately.
    
    The policy:
    - Name: "Test: Label all emails"
    - Action: label_email
    - Condition: exists("email_id") - matches all emails
    - Priority: 50 (higher than learned policies at 40)
    - Confidence: 0.7
