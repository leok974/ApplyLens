    Break the circular dependency between emails and applications tables.
    
    The circular FK cycle prevents proper table creation and can cause
    deadlocks during bulk operations. We drop the inline FKs and recreate
    them as DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED constraints.
    
    Note: This migration is only relevant if the FK columns exist. If they
    don't exist yet (fresh DB), this migration is a no-op.
