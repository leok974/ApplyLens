# Root /src Directory - Status Unknown

**TODO(legacy?)**: Flagged in REPO_AUDIT_PHASE1.md for review.

This directory appears to be empty or minimal. It may be:
- Legacy frontend code (superseded by `apps/web/src`)
- An old project structure artifact
- Or serving a specific purpose

**Action Required**: Determine if this is:
1. Safe to delete (if truly empty/unused)
2. Has a purpose and should be documented
3. Should be merged into the main app structure
