# Deployment Summary - v0.4.47e

## 🎯 Objective
Implement E2E tests and frontend logic fixes for conversational mailbox assistant with improved small talk handling and standardized rendering.

## 📦 Changes Deployed

### PART 1: Frontend Logic Fixes (MailChat.tsx)

#### 1A. Small Talk Detection Enhancement
**File:** `apps/web/src/components/MailChat.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `"help?"` to small talk detection patterns
- Updated function parameter from `text` to `raw` for consistency
- Small talk patterns now include:
  - Basic greetings: hi, hey, hello, yo, sup
  - Help queries: help, help?
  - Capability questions: what can you do, who are you, what are you
  - Help scope: what can you help with

#### 1B. sendViaAssistant() Function Refactor
**Changes:**
- Added `explicitText?: string` parameter for programmatic calls
- Refactored to use `userText = (explicitText ?? input).trim()`
- Push user message with timestamp before processing
- Clear input field immediately after submission
- Small talk short-circuit returns stub `assistantResponse` with all required fields
- Normal path uses `queryMailboxAssistant()` API
- Error handling includes stub `assistantResponse` for UI consistency
- Removed old `send()` function call in favor of `sendViaAssistant()`

**Updated callers:**
- Input field Enter key: `handleKeyPress()` → calls `sendViaAssistant()`
- Send button click: `onClick` → calls `sendViaAssistant()`
- Quick action chips: Already calling `sendViaAssistant(action.text)`

#### 1C. Standardized Assistant Message Rendering
**Changes:**
- Removed legacy empty state block ("🕵️ No emails found...")
- Unified rendering path uses `AssistantFollowupBlock` component
- Message structure:
  1. Summary/content (msg.content)
  2. Timestamp (if present)
  3. AssistantFollowupBlock (next_steps + followup_prompt)
  4. Utility buttons (Sync 7/60 days, Open Search) for empty states
  5. Suggested actions (draft reply buttons)

**AssistantFollowupBlock Component:**
```tsx
- Shows next_steps in neutral text
- Shows "You could ask:" prompt with followup_prompt in italics
- Styled card with bg-neutral-900/60 background
- Only renders if next_steps or followup_prompt present
```

### PART 2: Playwright E2E Test

**File:** `apps/web/tests/mailboxAssistant.spec.ts`

**Test Coverage:**
- Navigates to `/chat` page
- Types "hi" and presses Enter
- Asserts "I can:" onboarding text visible
- Asserts "You could ask:" coaching visible
- Asserts legacy "No emails found matching your query" NOT present
- Tagged with `@prodSafe` for production testing

**Config Update:**
- Added `"mailboxAssistant.spec.ts"` to `testMatch` array in `playwright.config.ts`

**Note:** Test requires authentication setup. Backend contract testing completed successfully via PowerShell script.

### PART 3: Backend Contract Test

**File:** `scripts/test_assistant_endpoints.ps1`

**Test Coverage:**
- POSTs to `/api/assistant/query` with "show suspicious emails"
- Validates JSON response contains required fields:
  - `summary`
  - `next_steps`
  - `followup_prompt`
  - `sources`
  - `suggested_actions`
  - `actions_performed`

**Status:** ✅ PASSED
```
✅ backend contract looks good
```

- [x] Web logs show healthy nginx workers

### Code Changes
- [x] Small talk detection includes "help?"
- [x] sendViaAssistant() uses explicitText parameter
- [x] Legacy empty state block removed
- [x] AssistantFollowupBlock renders consistently
- [x] Playwright test created
- [x] Backend contract test created

## 📋 Manual Testing Required

Since automated E2E requires auth setup, perform these manual tests:

### Test 1: Small Talk - "hi"
1. Navigate to https://applylens.app/chat
2. Type "hi" and press Enter
3. Verify:
   - ✅ No backend call (check Network tab)
   - ✅ Onboarding message appears: "Hi 👋 I'm your mailbox assistant..."
   - ✅ "You could ask:" section visible
   - ✅ NO "No emails found..." text

### Test 2: Small Talk Variations
Test: hey, hello, help, help?, what can you do, who are you
- ✅ Each triggers onboarding response
- ✅ No backend calls

### Test 3: Normal Query - "show suspicious emails"
1. Type query and press Enter
2. Verify:
   - ✅ Backend call made
   - ✅ Results or empty state with coaching
   - ✅ "You could ask:" visible
   - ✅ Utility buttons visible
   - ✅ NO legacy empty state

### Test 4: Console Version
- ✅ DevTools console shows "v0.4.47e"
- ✅ Build date: 2025-10-26

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Playwright E2E authentication**
   - Automated test requires `tests/.auth/prod.json` for production
   - Recommendation: Manual testing or setup prod auth storage state
