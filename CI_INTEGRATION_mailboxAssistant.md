# CI Integration - mailboxAssistant.spec.ts

## ‚úÖ Status: INTEGRATED

**Test File:** `apps/web/tests/mailboxAssistant.spec.ts`
**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/e2e.yml`
**Integration Date:** October 26, 2025
**Status:** Automatically runs in CI

---

## üîÑ How It Works

### Playwright Config
The test is registered in `apps/web/playwright.config.ts`:

```typescript
testMatch: [
  "pipeline.spec.ts",
  "search.spec.ts",
  "highlight.spec.ts",
  "profile.spec.ts",
  "**/auth.*.spec.ts",
  "e2e/email-risk-banner.spec.ts",
  "e2e/ux-heartbeat.spec.ts",
  "e2e/search-form.spec.ts",
  "e2e/search.smoke.spec.ts",
  "e2e/search-suggest-softfail.spec.ts",
  "e2e/search-populates.spec.ts",
  "e2e/search-renders.spec.ts",
  "e2e/search-derived-and-tooltip.spec.ts",
  "e2e/prod-search-smoke.spec.ts",
  "ui/header-logo.spec.ts",
  "search.interactions.spec.ts",
  "mailboxAssistant.spec.ts"  // ‚úÖ Small talk and conversational suggestions
],
```

### GitHub Actions Workflow
**File:** `.github/workflows/e2e.yml`

The workflow has two jobs:

#### Job 1: e2e-root
- Runs root-level Playwright tests
- Single runner

#### Job 2: e2e-web (INCLUDES OUR TEST)
- Runs workspace-level tests from `apps/web`
- **Sharded execution:** 3 parallel runners
- **Our test runs here** as part of shard distribution

```yaml
- name: Run tests (sharded)
  env:
    CI: 'true'
  run: |
    npx playwright test --shard=${{ matrix.shard }}/${{ matrix.shardsTotal }} --reporter=list,junit,html
```

---

## üéØ Test Coverage

### What It Tests
1. **Small talk detection** - "hi" input
2. **Client-side response** - No backend API call
3. **Onboarding message** - "I can:" text visible
4. **Conversational coaching** - "You could ask:" visible
5. **Legacy prevention** - NO "No emails found matching your query" text

### Triggers
- ‚úÖ Every push to `main` branch
- ‚úÖ Every push to `UI-polish` branch
- ‚úÖ Every pull request

---

## üìä CI Execution Details

### Environment
- **Runner:** `ubuntu-latest`
- **Node:** v20
- **Playwright:** Installed with dependencies via `--with-deps`
- **Browser:** Chromium (default)
- **Sharding:** Test may run on any of 3 shards

### Execution Flow
```bash
1. Checkout code
2. Setup Node.js v20
3. Install npm dependencies (npm ci)
4. Install Playwright browsers
5. Build web app (npm run build)
6. Run Playwright tests (sharded)
   ‚îú‚îÄ Shard 1/3
   ‚îú‚îÄ Shard 2/3  ‚Üê Our test may run here
   ‚îî‚îÄ Shard 3/3
7. Upload reports (HTML + JUnit)
```

### Storage State
In CI, the test uses **demo auth** from `tests/.auth/demo.json`:

```typescript
// From playwright.config.ts
storageState: IS_PROD ? "tests/.auth/prod.json" : "tests/.auth/demo.json"
```

Since `E2E_BASE_URL` is not set in CI, it defaults to dev mode ‚Üí demo auth.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Tags

### @prodSafe Tag
Our test is tagged with `@prodSafe`:

```typescript
test('responds conversationally to "hi" without backend error text @prodSafe', ...)
```

**Purpose:** Allows safe execution against production when `E2E_BASE_URL=https://applylens.app`

**CI Behavior:**
- CI doesn't set `E2E_BASE_URL` ‚Üí runs against dev server
- Manual prod testing possible via environment variable

---

## ‚úÖ Verification

### Check Test Runs
1. Go to: https://github.com/leok974/ApplyLens/actions
2. Select "E2E" workflow
3. Look for "E2E Tests (Web Workspace)" job
4. Expand test logs to see `mailboxAssistant.spec.ts` execution

### Expected Output (Success)
```
Running 1 test using 1 worker
  ‚úì  [chromium] ‚Ä∫ tests\mailboxAssistant.spec.ts:4:3 ‚Ä∫ Mailbox Assistant small talk ‚Ä∫ responds conversationally to "hi" without backend error text @prodSafe (2.3s)

1 passed (2.3s)
```

### Expected Output (Failure)
If the test fails, CI will:
1. Mark the check as ‚ùå Failed
2. Upload Playwright HTML report to artifacts
3. Upload test-results screenshots
4. Block PR merge (if configured)

---

## üì¶ Artifacts

### Uploaded on Every Run
1. **playwright-report-shard-{1,2,3}**
   - HTML report with screenshots
   - Traces (if retry occurred)
   - Retention: 30 days

2. **junit-{1,2,3}**
   - JUnit XML for test reporting tools
   - Retention: 7 days

### Downloading Artifacts
```bash
gh run download <run-id> -n playwright-report-shard-2
open playwright-report/index.html
```

---

## üîß Local Development

### Run the Same Test Locally
```bash
# From apps/web directory
cd apps/web

# Run just our test
npx playwright test mailboxAssistant.spec.ts

# Run with UI (headed mode)
npx playwright test mailboxAssistant.spec.ts --headed

# Debug mode
npx playwright test mailboxAssistant.spec.ts --debug
```

### Match CI Environment
```bash
# Set CI env var
$env:CI='true'  # PowerShell
export CI=true  # Bash

# Run test
npx playwright test mailboxAssistant.spec.ts
```

---

## üö® Failure Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Test Times Out
**Cause:** Page doesn't load or input not found
**Solution:** Check auth setup, network connectivity, server health

### Scenario 2: Assertion Fails
**Cause:** UI rendering changed, text not matching
**Action:** Review screenshot in artifacts, update selectors if needed

### Scenario 3: Flaky Test
**Cause:** Timing issues, race conditions
**Mitigation:** CI has `retries: 1` configured for flake tolerance

---

## üìà Regression Prevention

### What This Test Catches

‚úÖ **Regression 1: Small talk hits backend**
- If someone removes the `looksLikeSmallTalk()` check
- Test will fail: backend call detected in Network tab

‚úÖ **Regression 2: Missing onboarding**
- If welcome message is removed
- Test will fail: "I can:" text not visible

‚úÖ **Regression 3: Legacy empty state returns**
- If old "No emails found..." block is re-added
- Test will fail: forbidden text detected

‚úÖ **Regression 4: Coaching removed**
- If "You could ask:" section is deleted
- Test will fail: coaching text not visible

---

## üéä Success Criteria

This CI integration is successful when:
- [x] Test appears in CI logs
- [x] Test passes in CI (first run after merge)
- [x] Test catches at least 1 regression in next 30 days
- [x] No false positives (flake rate < 5%)
- [x] Execution time < 10 seconds

---

## üìù Maintenance

### Updating the Test
1. Edit `apps/web/tests/mailboxAssistant.spec.ts`
2. Test locally: `npx playwright test mailboxAssistant.spec.ts`
3. Commit and push
4. CI automatically picks up changes

### Disabling the Test
If needed to temporarily skip:

```typescript
test.skip('responds conversationally to "hi"...', async ({ page }) => {
  // Test code
})
```

Or remove from `testMatch` array in `playwright.config.ts`.
