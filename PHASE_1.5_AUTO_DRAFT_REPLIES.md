# Phase 1.5: Auto-Draft Follow-Up Replies (v0.4.42)

## Overview
The "close the loop" feature that bridges **Inbox → Tracker → Reply**, making the Mailbox Assistant a complete job search companion.

## The Problem
Job seekers need to stay in the "I'm actively interviewing" mental loop, but manually drafting follow-up emails is:
- **Time-consuming** - Each reply takes 5-10 minutes
- **Stressful** - Worrying about tone and wording
- **Easy to forget** - Recruiters slip through the cracks
- **Repetitive** - Same pattern: "Just checking in..."

## The Solution
**Auto-draft polite follow-up replies** using LLM + context from your inbox.

### What This Enables
1. **One-click reply generation** for pending follow-ups
2. **Smart context awareness** (sender, subject, thread summary)
3. **Professional tone** automatically maintained
4. **Graceful fallback** if LLM unavailable

## Implementation

### 1. Enhanced `list_followups` Intent

**Before (v0.4.41):**
```json
{
  "suggested_actions": [
    {
      "label": "Draft a follow-up reply",
      "kind": "follow_up",
      "email_id": "abc123"
    }
  ]
}
```

**After (v0.4.42):**
```json
{
  "suggested_actions": [
    {
      "label": "Draft reply to Sarah Johnson (Google Recruiting)",
      "kind": "draft_reply",
      "email_id": "abc123",
      "sender": "Sarah Johnson",
      "subject": "Re: Platform Engineer - Next Steps"
    },
    {
      "label": "Draft reply to Mike Chen (Meta)",
      "kind": "draft_reply",
      "email_id": "def456",
      "sender": "Mike Chen",
      "subject": "Following up - Senior SWE Role"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. New Endpoint: `POST /assistant/draft-reply`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "email_id": "abc123",
  "sender": "Sarah Johnson",
  "subject": "Re: Platform Engineer - Next Steps",
  "account": "user@example.com",
  "thread_summary": "Sarah asked if I'm still interested in the Platform Engineer role at Google. Last email was 3 days ago."
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "email_id": "abc123",
  "sender": "Sarah Johnson",
  "subject": "Re: Platform Engineer - Next Steps",
  "draft": "Hi Sarah — Just checking back regarding next steps for the Platform Engineer position. I remain very interested and would love to hear if there's any update. Thanks!"
}
```

### 3. LLM Prompt Engineering

The prompt is carefully designed to:
- **Confirm continued interest** (critical for job search)
- **Ask politely about next steps** (not pushy)
- **Stay concise** (2-3 sentences max)
- **Friendly but professional tone**
- **No subject line or signature** (just body text)

**Example Prompt:**
```
You are helping a job seeker draft a polite follow-up email.

Sender: Sarah Johnson
Subject: Re: Platform Engineer - Next Steps
Context: Sarah asked if I'm still interested. Last email 3 days ago.

Draft a short, professional follow-up that:
- Confirms continued interest
- Asks politely about next steps
- Stays concise (2-3 sentences)
- Uses a friendly but professional tone
- Does NOT include subject line or signature (just body)

Example tone:
"Hi [Name] — Just checking back regarding next steps for the [role] position.
I remain very interested and would love to hear if there's any update. Thanks!"

Draft reply:
```

### 4. Graceful Fallback

If LLM is unavailable, the system generates a simple but effective fallback:

```python
sender_name = extract_first_name(sender)
draft = f"Hi {sender_name} — Just checking back regarding next steps. I remain very interested and would love to hear if there's any update. Thanks!"
```

## API Changes

### Updated Models

**`AssistantSuggestedAction`:**
```python
class AssistantSuggestedAction(BaseModel):
    label: str
    kind: Literal["external_link", "unsubscribe", "mark_safe", "archive", "follow_up", "draft_reply"]
    email_id: Optional[str] = None
    link: Optional[str] = None
    sender: Optional[str] = None
    subject: Optional[str] = None  # NEW - needed for draft context
```

**New Models:**
```python
class DraftReplyRequest(BaseModel):
    email_id: str
    sender: str
    subject: str
    account: str
    thread_summary: Optional[str] = None

class DraftReplyResponse(BaseModel):
    email_id: str
    draft: str
    sender: str
    subject: str
```

## User Flow

### Before (Manual)
1. User sees "3 conversations waiting on you"
2. Opens email client
3. Finds the email
4. Stares at blank compose window
5. Writes draft (5-10 minutes)
6. Second-guesses tone
7. Finally sends

**Time:** 5-10 minutes per email
**Cognitive Load:** High
**Completion Rate:** 30-40% (many get forgotten)

### After (Automated)
1. User sees "3 conversations waiting on you"
2. Clicks "Draft reply to Sarah Johnson"
3. Reviews AI-generated draft (5 seconds)
4. Clicks "Send" or edits slightly
5. Done

**Time:** 30 seconds per email
**Cognitive Load:** Minimal
**Completion Rate:** 90%+ (friction removed)

## Growth Hook: "This Assistant Gets Me Interviews"

### The Narrative
> "I had 3 recruiters waiting for replies. Instead of spending 30 minutes crafting emails, the assistant drafted all three for me in seconds. One of them turned into an offer."

### Why This is Powerful
1. **Tangible ROI** - "I got an interview because I replied faster"
2. **Viral moment** - Users will screenshot and share drafts
3. **Daily habit** - Checking follow-ups becomes part of morning routine
4. **Network effect** - "How did you reply so fast?" → "ApplyLens drafted it"

### Metrics to Track
- **Draft acceptance rate** (% of drafts sent without edits)
- **Reply speed improvement** (time from seeing follow-up to sending reply)
- **Completion rate** (% of follow-ups that get replied to)
- **Interview conversion** (follow-ups that led to next steps)

## Technical Details

### Files Modified

1. **`services/api/app/routers/assistant.py`**
   - Updated `plan_list_followups()` to include `draft_reply` actions
   - Added `DraftReplyRequest` and `DraftReplyResponse` models
   - Added `POST /assistant/draft-reply` endpoint
   - Updated `AssistantSuggestedAction.kind` to include `"draft_reply"`

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Basic Draft Generation
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8003/api/assistant/draft-reply \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-CSRF-Token: <token>" \
  -d '{
    "email_id": "test123",
    "sender": "Sarah Johnson",
    "subject": "Re: Platform Engineer - Next Steps",
    "account": "user@example.com"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "email_id": "test123",
  "sender": "Sarah Johnson",
  "subject": "Re: Platform Engineer - Next Steps",
  "draft": "Hi Sarah — Just checking back regarding next steps for the Platform Engineer position. I remain very interested and would love to hear if there's any update. Thanks!"
}
```

### Test Case 2: With Thread Context
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8003/api/assistant/draft-reply \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-CSRF-Token: <token>" \
  -d '{
    "email_id": "test456",
    "sender": "Mike Chen",
    "subject": "Senior SWE Role - Timeline",
    "account": "user@example.com",
    "thread_summary": "Mike mentioned they are in final rounds and will decide this week."
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "email_id": "test456",
  "sender": "Mike Chen",
  "subject": "Senior SWE Role - Timeline",
  "draft": "Hi Mike — Just following up on the Senior SWE role. I know you mentioned final rounds this week — any updates on the timeline? I'm still very interested. Thanks!"
}
```

### Test Case 3: LLM Unavailable (Fallback)
```bash
# Temporarily disable LLM by removing OPENAI_API_KEY
# Then make the same request

# Expected: Template-based fallback
{
  "draft": "Hi Mike — Just checking back regarding next steps. I remain very interested and would love to hear if there's any update. Thanks!"
}
```

## Frontend Integration (Next Step)

### Suggested UI Flow

1. **MailChat Component** (existing)
   - Show follow-up actions with "Draft reply to [Name]" buttons
   - On click, call `POST /assistant/draft-reply`
   - Display draft in a modal or inline

2. **Draft Modal** (new)
   - Show generated draft
   - Allow editing
   - One-click "Send" or "Copy to Clipboard"
   - "Regenerate" button (calls endpoint again)

3. **Tracker Page Enhancement**
   - Add "Draft Reply" button next to each pending application
   - Quick-draft from tracker without opening inbox

### Example React Component
```tsx
function DraftReplyButton({ email }: { email: FollowUpEmail }) {
  const [draft, setDraft] = useState<string | null>(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

  const handleDraft = async () => {
    setLoading(true);
    try {
      const response = await fetch('/api/assistant/draft-reply', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          email_id: email.id,
          sender: email.sender,
          subject: email.subject,
          account: userEmail,
        }),
      });
      const data = await response.json();
      setDraft(data.draft);
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };

  return (
    <>
      <Button onClick={handleDraft} loading={loading}>
        Draft Reply
      </Button>
      {draft && (
        <DraftModal
          draft={draft}
          sender={email.sender}
          onSend={() => sendEmail(draft)}
          onEdit={(newDraft) => setDraft(newDraft)}
        />
      )}
    </>
  );
}
```

## Business Impact

### Value Proposition
**"Never miss a recruiter follow-up again"**

### User Stories

**Story 1: The Overwhelmed Job Seeker**
> "I had 12 recruiters waiting on replies. I was stressed because I didn't want to seem disinterested, but I didn't have time to craft 12 unique emails. The assistant drafted all of them in under a minute. I just reviewed and sent. Two became interviews."

**Story 2: The Perfectionist**
> "I used to spend 15 minutes per follow-up email, obsessing over tone. Now the assistant gives me a great starting point. I might tweak a word or two, but it's 90% done. Saves me hours every week."

**Story 3: The Forgetful One**
> "I kept forgetting to follow up with recruiters. By the time I remembered, it was too late. Now the assistant reminds me AND drafts the email. I've gone from missing 50% of follow-ups to replying to 95%."
