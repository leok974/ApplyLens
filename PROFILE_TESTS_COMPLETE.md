# Profile Warehouse Tests - Implementation Complete ✅

## Summary

Successfully created **production-safe** Playwright tests for the warehouse-backed Profile page that:
- ✅ Run WITHOUT backend infrastructure (no uvicorn, PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Elasticsearch)
- ✅ Use `page.route()` mocks for all API calls
- ✅ Pass consistently (3/3 tests passing)
- ✅ Can run in CI/CD pipelines
- ✅ Follow existing test patterns (`mailboxAssistant.spec.ts`)

## What Was Created

### 1. Mock Helper - `tests/utils/mockProfileSession.ts`

Centralized mock function that intercepts:
- `/api/config` → Runtime configuration
- `/api/auth/me` → User session (fakes logged-in state)
- `/api/metrics/profile/summary` → Warehouse analytics data

```typescript
import { mockProfileSession } from "./utils/mockProfileSession";

test("my test", async ({ page }) => {
  await mockProfileSession(page);
  await page.goto("http://localhost:5175/profile");
  // Assertions...
});
```

### 2. Updated Test Suite - `tests/profile-warehouse.spec.ts`

Three comprehensive tests:

**Test 1: "renders analytics cards from warehouse summary"**
- Mocks full warehouse data
- Verifies all 4 cards render (Email Activity, Top Senders, Top Categories, Top Interests)
- Checks specific values from mocked data
- Verifies warehouse attribution badge

**Test 2: "handles empty state gracefully"**
- Mocks empty warehouse response (no senders, categories, or interests)
- Verifies cards still render
- Checks "No data yet" messages appear

**Test 3: "handles API failure gracefully with fallback"**
- Mocks 500 error from warehouse endpoint
- Verifies component uses fallback data (empty arrays, zeros)
- Confirms graceful degradation

### 3. Documentation - `tests/README.test.md`

Complete guide covering:
- How to run mock-based tests vs full-stack tests
- Environment setup (`SKIP_AUTH=1`)
- Debugging tips
- Common issues and solutions
- CI/CD integration notes

## How to Run

```powershell
# 1. Start frontend dev server (if not already running)
cd d:\ApplyLens\apps\web
npm run dev

# 2. In another terminal, run tests
cd d:\ApplyLens\apps\web
$env:SKIP_AUTH='1'
npx playwright test tests/profile-warehouse.spec.ts --reporter=line
```

## Test Results

```
⏭️  Skipping auth setup (SKIP_AUTH=1)

Running 3 tests using 1 worker
  ✅ renders analytics cards from warehouse summary
  ✅ handles empty state gracefully
  ✅ handles API failure gracefully with fallback

3 passed (3.7s)
```

## Why This Approach Works

### Before (Blocked):
- ❌ Tests required full backend stack
- ❌ Needed PostgreSQL database
- ❌ Required BigQuery connection
- ❌ Couldn't run without Docker
- ❌ Auth setup failed without live services

### After (Working):
- ✅ Only needs frontend dev server on port 5175
- ✅ All API calls mocked with `page.route()`
- ✅ `SKIP_AUTH=1` bypasses real authentication
- ✅ `mockProfileSession()` fakes logged-in state
- ✅ Tests deterministic with controlled mock data

## Integration with Existing Tests

The profile warehouse tests follow the same pattern as:
- `mailboxAssistant.spec.ts` - Also uses mocks, no backend
- Other `[prodSafe]` tests

Configuration in `playwright.config.ts`:
```typescript
testMatch: [
  // ... other tests
  "profile-warehouse.spec.ts",  // ✅ Included
  "mailboxAssistant.spec.ts"    // ✅ Same group
]
```

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Direct Navigation**: Tests go directly to `http://localhost:5175/profile`
   - No need to start from home page
   - No need to click through navigation
   - Faster test execution

2. **Mock Before Navigate**: `mockProfileSession()` called BEFORE `page.goto()`
   - Ensures all requests are intercepted
   - Prevents race conditions
   - More reliable

3. **Specific Assertions**: Tests verify actual mocked data
   - Not just "page loads"
   - Checks specific numbers (1,234 emails, 87 in last 30 days)
   - Validates proper data binding

4. **Graceful Degradation**: Tests verify fallback behavior
   - Empty states render correctly
   - API failures don't crash the page
   - User sees meaningful messages

## Files Modified/Created

```
✅ Created: apps/web/tests/utils/mockProfileSession.ts
✅ Updated: apps/web/tests/profile-warehouse.spec.ts
✅ Created: apps/web/tests/README.test.md
✅ Verified: apps/web/playwright.config.ts (already configured)
```

## Next Steps

These tests are now:
- ✅ Ready for CI/CD integration
- ✅ Safe to run in production environment
- ✅ Independent of backend infrastructure
- ✅ Maintainable and extensible

To add more mock-based tests:
1. Use `mockProfileSession()` as a template
2. Add custom mocks for new endpoints
3. Follow the same pattern (mock → navigate → assert)
4. Mark as `[prodSafe]` in test description
