# Production Test Authentication Fix

**Date**: October 24, 2025
**Status**: ✅ **DEPLOYED**

---

## Issue

Production-safe E2E tests (`prod-search-smoke.spec.ts`) were failing when run against https://applylens.app because the authentication detection wasn't working properly.

**Root Cause**:
- Tests used `page.url().includes("/welcome")` to detect login page
- Production shows "Sign In Required" page but not at `/welcome` route
- The `getByRole("heading")` and `getByRole("link")` selectors weren't finding elements in time

---

## Solution

Changed authentication detection to use simple page content check:

```typescript
// Before (didn't work):
const isLoginPage = await page.url().includes("/welcome");

// After (works reliably):
await page.waitForTimeout(1000);
const pageContent = await page.content();
if (pageContent.includes("Sign In Required") ||
    pageContent.includes("Please sign in to access this page")) {
  test.skip(true, "Skipping - authentication required for production");
  return;
}
```

---

## Test Results

### Production (https://applylens.app)
```bash
cd d:\ApplyLens\apps\web
npm run test:prod-safe

✓ 4 tests skipped (authentication required)
```

**Result**: ✅ Tests skip gracefully when not authenticated

### Development (localhost)
```bash
cd d:\ApplyLens\apps\web
npx playwright test tests/e2e/prod-search-smoke.spec.ts --reporter=list

✓ 4 tests passed (8.7s)
  1. search page loads and shows results list - 1.2s
  2. tooltip appears on scoring pill (v0.4.22 feature) - 3.8s
  3. active filters show visual feedback (v0.4.22 feature) - 1.5s
  4. scores are displayed correctly (v0.4.22 feature) - 1.2s
```

**Result**: ✅ All tests pass with demo auth

---

## Files Modified

1. **`apps/web/tests/e2e/prod-search-smoke.spec.ts`**
   - Updated all 4 tests with improved auth detection
   - Changed from URL/element checking to page content checking
   - Added 1s wait for page to fully load
   - More reliable detection of sign-in page

2. **`services/api/app/gmail_service.py`**
   - Fixed Python linting error (moved `import logging` to top)
   - Unrelated fix required by pre-commit hooks

---

## Deployment

**Commit**: `5d92bb4` - "fix: improve prod test auth detection using page content check"

**Pushed to**: `origin/demo` branch

**Production Status**:
- Web container: v0.4.22 (already deployed, unchanged)
- Test files: Updated in repository only
- No rebuild/redeploy needed (tests run outside containers)

---

## Testing Workflow

### After Any Production Deployment

```bash
# Run production-safe smoke tests
cd d:\ApplyLens\apps\web
npm run test:prod-safe
```

**Expected Results**:
- **If not authenticated**: 4 tests skipped ✓ (safe, expected)
- **If authenticated**: 4 tests pass ✓ (validates v0.4.22 features)
- **If any failures**: Investigate (real issue detected)

---

## Benefits

✅ **Reliable detection** - Works regardless of routing
✅ **Fast execution** - 1s timeout instead of multiple 3s+ selector waits
✅ **Clear intent** - Checks actual page content, not DOM structure
✅ **Graceful skipping** - No false failures on unauthenticated sessions
✅ **Production-safe** - Read-only operations, no mutations

---

## Future Improvements

1. **Add authenticated production testing**:
   - Save production session cookies to `tests/.auth/prod.json`
   - Run tests with full validation after each deployment

2. **Add more @prodSafe tests**:
   - Email risk banner display
   - Navigation between pages
   - Header/footer elements

3. **CI/CD integration**:
   - Run prod-safe tests automatically after deployments
   - Alert on failures

**Status**: ✅ **FIX COMPLETE AND DEPLOYED**

Production-safe tests now work reliably in both development (pass) and production (skip gracefully when not authenticated).
