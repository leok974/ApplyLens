# Archive & Auto-Delete Feature - Deployment Summary
**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Feature:** Archive & Auto-Delete Lifecycle for Rejected Applications

## ‚úÖ Deployment Status: SUCCESSFUL

### Migration Applied
- **Migration ID:** `0019_archive_fields`
- **Parent:** `0017_phase6_personalization`
- **Applied:** October 20, 2025 @ 19:28 UTC

### Database Changes ‚úÖ
The following columns were successfully added to the `applications` table:

| Column | Type | Default | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|---------|
| `archived_at` | `timestamp with time zone` | NULL | Timestamp when application was archived |
| `deleted_at` | `timestamp with time zone` | NULL | Timestamp when application was deleted |
| `archive_opt_out` | `boolean` | false | User opt-out for auto-archive |
| `auto_delete_opt_out` | `boolean` | false | User opt-out for auto-delete |

### Indexes Created ‚úÖ
- `ix_applications_archived_at` - Index on archived_at timestamp
- `ix_applications_deleted_at` - Index on deleted_at timestamp
- `ix_applications_status_archived` - Composite index on (status, archived_at)

### Backend Components Deployed ‚úÖ

#### 1. Configuration (services/api/app/config.py)
```python
AUTO_ARCHIVE_REJECTED_AFTER_DAYS = 14   # Auto-archive rejected apps after 14 days
AUTO_DELETE_ARCHIVED_AFTER_DAYS = 90    # Auto-delete archived apps after 90 days
ARCHIVE_GRACE_UNDO_HOURS = 48           # 48-hour grace period for undo
```

#### 2. API Endpoints (services/api/app/routes_applications.py)
- ‚úÖ `POST /applications/{id}/archive` - Archive a single application
- ‚úÖ `POST /applications/{id}/restore` - Restore an archived application
- ‚úÖ `DELETE /applications/{id}` - Hard delete an application (requires archived)
- ‚úÖ `POST /applications/bulk/archive` - Bulk archive multiple applications

All endpoints include:
- Elasticsearch sync (tombstone/upsert/delete)
- Audit logging
- Error handling with graceful ES failure

#### 3. Scheduled Cleanup Job (services/api/app/cron/archive_cleanup.py)
- ‚úÖ Auto-archives rejected applications after 14 days
- ‚úÖ Auto-deletes archived applications after 90 days
- ‚úÖ Respects opt-out flags
- ‚úÖ Syncs with Elasticsearch
- ‚úÖ Logs audit events
- ‚úÖ Supports `--dry-run` mode for safe testing

**Test Run Results:**
```
2025-10-20 19:29:09 - INFO - Settings: archive_after=14d, delete_after=90d, grace_period=48h
2025-10-20 19:29:09 - INFO - Found 0 applications to auto-archive
2025-10-20 19:29:09 - INFO - Found 0 applications to auto-delete
2025-10-20 19:29:09 - INFO - DRY RUN complete: would archive 0, would delete 0
```

#### 4. Elasticsearch Utilities (services/api/app/utils/es_applications.py)
- ‚úÖ `es_tombstone_application()` - Sets visible=false on archive
- ‚úÖ `es_upsert_application()` - Re-indexes on restore with visible=true
- ‚úÖ `es_delete_application()` - Removes document on hard delete
- ‚úÖ `es_available()` - Connection health check

#### 5. Audit Logging ‚úÖ
All archive lifecycle events are logged with action types:
- `application.archive`
- `application.restore`
- `application.delete`
- `application.auto_archive`
- `application.auto_delete`

### Migration Chain Fix üîß
Fixed a migration chain issue where `0018_consent_log.py` referenced a non-existent parent:
- **Before:** `down_revision = '0017_previous_migration'` ‚ùå
- **After:** `down_revision = '0017_policy_bundles'` ‚úÖ

This fix was necessary to apply all pending migrations and allowed the system to successfully upgrade to all three current heads:
- `0027_incident_metadata_rename` (head)
- `0018_consent_log` (head)
- `0019_archive_fields` (head)

### Container Updates
- API container rebuilt with latest migration files
- Container recreated to ensure fresh code load
- All migrations applied successfully

### Verification Steps Completed ‚úÖ
1. ‚úÖ Migration chain validated
2. ‚úÖ Database columns verified with `\d applications`
3. ‚úÖ Indexes confirmed in database
4. ‚úÖ Cleanup job tested with `--dry-run`
5. ‚úÖ ES utilities file deployed to container
6. ‚úÖ API container healthy and responding

## üìã Next Steps

### Immediate (Required for Full Feature)
1. **UI Implementation** - Frontend components for archive actions
   - Row actions (Archive/Restore/Delete buttons)
   - "Show Archived" toggle filter
   - Settings panel for retention policy configuration
   - Details panel banner with Undo button (within grace period)

2. **Testing** - Comprehensive test coverage
   - Unit tests for time-based logic
   - API integration tests for all endpoints
   - Playwright E2E tests with data-testid hooks

### Production Checklist
- [ ] Schedule cleanup job (cron/Task Scheduler)
  ```bash
  # Example cron: Run daily at 2 AM
  0 2 * * * docker exec applylens-api-prod python -m app.cron.archive_cleanup
  ```
- [ ] Monitor audit logs for first week
- [ ] Verify Elasticsearch sync behavior
- [ ] Test restore functionality with real data
- [ ] Document retention policy in user-facing docs

### Configuration Notes
Current retention policy:
- **Auto-Archive:** 14 days after rejection
- **Auto-Delete:** 90 days after archive
- **Grace Period:** 48 hours for undo

These values can be adjusted via environment variables:
- `APPLYLENS_AUTO_ARCHIVE_REJECTED_AFTER_DAYS`
- `APPLYLENS_AUTO_DELETE_ARCHIVED_AFTER_DAYS`
- `APPLYLENS_ARCHIVE_GRACE_UNDO_HOURS`

### Safety Features Implemented ‚úÖ
- Opt-out flags prevent automatic processing
- Must archive before delete (enforced by API)
- Graceful ES failure handling (operations continue if ES down)
- Dry-run mode for testing
- Complete audit trail
- Grace period for undo
