2025-10-20 19:29:09 - INFO - [Archive Cleanup] Found 0 applications to auto-archive
2025-10-20 19:29:09 - INFO - [Archive Cleanup] Found 0 applications to auto-delete
2025-10-20 19:29:09 - INFO - DRY RUN complete: would archive 0, would delete 0
2025-10-20 19:29:09 - INFO - === Archive Cleanup Job Completed ===
```

**Result:** ✅ Job executes successfully with correct logic

### 5. Code Deployment - ✅ VERIFIED
**Files Present in Container:**
- `/app/cron/archive_cleanup.py` - 7,642 bytes ✅

## 📋 Feature Capabilities (Live)

### API Endpoints Available Now

1. **`POST /applications/{id}/archive`**
   - Archives a single application
   - Sets `archived_at` timestamp
   - Tombstones in Elasticsearch (`visible: false`)
   - Creates audit log entry

2. **`POST /applications/{id}/restore`**
   - Restores an archived application
   - Clears `archived_at` timestamp
   - Re-indexes in Elasticsearch (`visible: true`)
   - Creates audit log entry

3. **`DELETE /applications/{id}`**
   - Hard deletes an application
   - Requires application to be archived first
   - Removes from Elasticsearch
   - Creates audit log entry

4. **`POST /applications/bulk/archive`**
   - Archives multiple applications in one request
   - Efficient bulk operation
   - Syncs all to Elasticsearch

### Automated Lifecycle Management

**Auto-Archive Process:**
- Runs via scheduled job: `python -m app.cron.archive_cleanup`
- Targets: Applications with `status='rejected'` and `updated_at` > 14 days ago
- Skips: Applications with `archive_opt_out=true`
- Actions: Sets `archived_at`, tombstones in ES, logs audit event

**Auto-Delete Process:**
- Runs in same cleanup job
- Targets: Applications with `archived_at` > 90 days ago
- Skips: Applications with `auto_delete_opt_out=true`
- Actions: Hard deletes from DB, removes from ES, logs audit event

### Safety Features

✅ **Opt-out Flags:** Users can prevent auto-archive and/or auto-delete  
✅ **Grace Period:** 48-hour window to undo archive actions  
✅ **Audit Trail:** Complete logging of all archive lifecycle events  
✅ **ES Resilience:** Operations continue even if Elasticsearch is unavailable  
✅ **Dry-run Mode:** Test cleanup job without making changes  
✅ **Archive-before-delete:** API enforces archiving before hard deletion

---

## 🔍 Integration Points

### Elasticsearch Sync
- **On Archive:** Document tombstoned (`visible: false`)
- **On Restore:** Document re-indexed (`visible: true`)
- **On Delete:** Document removed from index
- **Default Search:** Should filter out archived applications

### Audit Logging
Events logged with full context:
- `application.archive` - Manual archive via API
- `application.restore` - Manual restore via API
- `application.delete` - Manual hard delete via API
- `application.auto_archive` - Automatic archive by job
- `application.auto_delete` - Automatic delete by job

---

## 📊 Current Production State

**Applications in Database:**
- Archived: 0 (newly deployed feature)
- Pending Auto-Archive: 0
- Pending Auto-Delete: 0

**Next Auto-Archive Window:**
- Will archive applications rejected before: October 6, 2025
- Next job run: Schedule pending (see Operational Tasks)

---

## 🚀 Operational Tasks

### Immediate (Required)

1. **Schedule Cleanup Job**
   ```bash
   # Recommended: Daily at 2 AM UTC
   # Windows Task Scheduler or cron equivalent:
   docker exec applylens-api-prod python -m app.cron.archive_cleanup
   ```

2. **Test with Real Data**
   - Create a test application with `status='rejected'`
   - Set `updated_at` to > 14 days ago
   - Run job and verify auto-archive behavior

3. **Monitor Audit Logs**
   - Watch for `application.auto_archive` events
   - Verify ES sync is working
   - Check for any errors in first week

### Short-term (Enhances Feature)

4. **Implement UI Components**
   - Row actions: Archive/Restore/Delete buttons
   - Filter toggle: "Show Archived" checkbox
   - Settings panel: Retention policy controls
   - Details banner: "Archived on {date} · Undo" (within 48h)

5. **Write Tests**
   - Unit tests: Time-based logic, opt-out flags
   - API tests: All endpoint scenarios
   - E2E tests: Full archive lifecycle with UI

6. **User Documentation**
   - Explain retention policy to users
   - Document opt-out process
   - Show grace period for undo

## 🎓 Troubleshooting Guide

### If Archive Job Fails
```bash
# Check job logs
docker logs applylens-api-prod | grep -i archive

# Run in dry-run mode to see what would happen
docker exec applylens-api-prod python -m app.cron.archive_cleanup --dry-run

# Check database connectivity
docker exec applylens-api-prod python -c "from app.database import SessionLocal; db = SessionLocal(); print('DB OK')"
```

### If Elasticsearch Sync Fails
- Job will continue (ES failures are non-blocking)
- Check logs for warnings: `ES sync failed for archive`
- Verify ES container health: `docker ps | grep es-prod`
- Manual re-sync available via API endpoints

### If Migration Issues Arise
```bash
# Check current migration state
docker exec applylens-api-prod alembic current

# View migration history
docker exec applylens-api-prod alembic history

# Rollback if needed (CAUTION: Data loss)
docker exec applylens-api-prod alembic downgrade -1
```
