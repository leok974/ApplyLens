# Phase 5.3 Completion Summary

**Implementation Date**: January 2025  
**Phase**: 5.3 - Active Learning + Judge Reliability  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## Overview

Phase 5.3 implements a **continuous learning loop** that automatically improves agent performance through:

1. **Labeled Data Collection** from approvals, feedback, and gold sets
2. **Heuristic Training** to update planner configs
3. **Judge Reliability Weighting** based on calibration
4. **Uncertainty Sampling** for human review
5. **Safe Bundle Deployment** via canary with auto-promote/rollback

This closes the learning loop from Phase 5 (Evaluation) and integrates with Phase 5.1 (Canary Routing) to create a self-improving system.

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Recommended Metrics
- **Labeled data growth rate**: Examples/day per source

- **Canary promotion time**: Avg hours from 10% → 100%
- **Judge weight stability**: Weekly variance per judge

2. Active Canaries (table)
3. Pending Approvals (table)
4. Judge Weights (heatmap)
5. Training Accuracy (bar chart)

### Alerts
- **Critical**: Canary regression + auto-rollback
- **Warning**: Canary stuck >72h, low data growth
- **Info**: Successful promotion, new bundle proposed

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Minimum Data Requirements**:
   - Need ≥50 labeled examples per agent for training
   - Lower bound may result in unstable models

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Feature extractors are agent-specific
   - New agents require manual feature definition

3. **Model Types**:
   - Currently supports logistic regression & decision trees
   - More complex models (gradient boosting, neural nets) not implemented

4. **Canary Limitations**:
   - Inherits 24h minimum monitoring from Phase 5.1
   - No A/B test statistical significance checking

5. **Manual Review Queue**:
   - No UI for labeling sampled predictions
   - Requires manual API calls or external tooling

---

## Future Enhancements

### Short Term (Phase 5.4?)
1. **API Endpoints**: Implement all 20+ endpoints listed above
2. **UI for Review Queue**: Streamlit app for labeling
3. **Synthetic Data**: LLM-generated edge cases
4. **Multi-Model Ensembles**: Combine logistic + tree predictions

### Long Term (Phase 6?)
1. **Active Prompting**: Use training data to suggest prompt improvements
2. **Multi-Agent Meta-Models**: Learn cross-agent patterns
3. **Cost Optimization**: Train models to balance quality vs inference cost
4. **Explainability**: Surface feature importances in agent decisions
5. **Federated Learning**: Privacy-preserving training across tenants
