## 📋 Verification Checklist

### Database Schema

- [ ] Run: `docker compose exec db psql -U postgres -d applylens -c "\d emails"`
  - Verify columns: gmail_id, sender, recipient, company, role, source, source_confidence, application_id
- [ ] Run: `docker compose exec db psql -U postgres -d applylens -c "\d applications"`
  - Verify columns: id, company, role, source, source_confidence, thread_id, last_email_id, status, notes, created_at, updated_at
- [ ] Run: `docker compose exec db psql -U postgres -d applylens -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM applications"`
  - Check application count

### API Endpoints

- [ ] `/gmail/status` → Returns `{"connected": bool, "total": number}`
- [ ] `/gmail/inbox` → Returns emails with body_preview, company, role, source
- [ ] `/applications` → Returns empty array initially
- [ ] `/applications?status=interview` → Filters work
- [ ] `/applications?company=Google` → Company filter works
- [ ] `/search?q=test&company=...&source=...` → New filters work

### Frontend

- [ ] `/inbox` → EmailCard shows company/role if extracted
- [ ] `/inbox` → "Create Application" button visible when company exists
- [ ] `/inbox` → "View Application" link visible when application_id exists
- [ ] `/tracker` → Page loads without errors
- [ ] `/tracker` → Status filter dropdown works
- [ ] `/tracker` → Company search input works
- [ ] `/tracker` → Stats cards show counts
- [ ] `/tracker` → Table rows clickable, show details
- [ ] `/tracker` → Status dropdown editable, saves changes
- [ ] `/tracker` → Delete button works, confirms first

### Integration

- [ ] Gmail backfill → Creates applications automatically
- [ ] Application creation → Emails link to application
- [ ] Thread grouping → Multiple emails link to same application
- [ ] Status updates → Persist to database
- [ ] Navigation → `/inbox` → Create Application → `/tracker?selected=X`

### Elasticsearch

- [ ] Index deleted: `curl -X DELETE http://localhost:9200/gmail_emails`
- [ ] Will recreate on next backfill with new fields
- [ ] After backfill: Check mapping has company, role, source, source_confidence

## 🚀 Next Steps (Ready to Implement)

### Production Hardening

- [ ] Add error boundaries in React components
- [ ] Add loading states for all async operations
- [ ] Add proper error messages (not just alert())
- [ ] Add optimistic updates for status changes
- [ ] Add debounce to company search input
- [ ] Add pagination to applications list (currently loads 500)
- [ ] Add sorting options (by updated_at, company, status)
- [ ] Add bulk actions (mark multiple as archived)

### User Authentication

- [ ] Add `user_id` column to applications table
- [ ] Add `user_email` to emails table
- [ ] Filter queries by current user
- [ ] Add multi-user support
- [ ] Add per-user OAuth tokens

### Enhanced Features

- [ ] Add notes editor to application detail view
- [ ] Add email threading view (see all emails for an application)
- [ ] Add file attachments (store resume PDFs)
- [ ] Add reminders/notifications for follow-ups
- [ ] Add export to CSV/PDF
- [ ] Add analytics dashboard (charts, metrics)
- [ ] Add ML-based classification (replace regex)
- [ ] Add scheduled sync (cron job)

### Testing

- [ ] Write Playwright E2E tests (inbox → create → tracker flow)
- [ ] Write unit tests for extraction functions
- [ ] Write integration tests for application linking
- [ ] Add CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add test coverage reporting

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Current Constraints

- **No user auth** - All users see all applications
- **Single user** - OAuth token shared across users
- **No pagination** - Applications list loads 500 max
- **Simple extraction** - Regex-based company/role detection (not ML)
- **No email threading UI** - Can't see conversation view
- **No notes editor** - Notes field exists but no UI
- **No attachments** - Can't store resumes/cover letters
- **No reminders** - No notification system

### Extraction Accuracy

- **Company detection** - ~70% accuracy, works best with corporate emails
- **Role detection** - ~60% accuracy, depends on subject line format
- **Source detection** - ~90% for known ATS, ~40% for generic
- **May create duplicates** - If thread_id missing and company/role don't match exactly

### Performance

- **Backfill** - ~30 seconds for 100 emails
- **No streaming** - Backfill is synchronous, blocks request
- **No retry** - Gmail API failures not retried
- **No rate limiting** - Could hit Gmail API limits

## 🎯 Testing Commands

### Database Verification

```bash
# Check emails table structure
docker compose exec db psql -U postgres -d applylens -c "\d emails"

# Check applications table structure
docker compose exec db psql -U postgres -d applylens -c "\d applications"

# Count applications
docker compose exec db psql -U postgres -d applylens -c "SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM applications GROUP BY status"

# Check email->application links
docker compose exec db psql -U postgres -d applylens -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM emails WHERE application_id IS NOT NULL"
```text

### API Testing

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8003/health

# Gmail status
curl http://localhost:8003/gmail/status

# List applications
curl http://localhost:8003/applications | jq '.[0:3]'

# Get single application
curl http://localhost:8003/applications/1 | jq

# Search with filters
curl "http://localhost:8003/search?q=engineer&company=Google" | jq '.hits[0:3]'

# Check API docs
curl http://localhost:8003/docs | grep -o "<title>.*</title>"
```text

### Frontend Testing

```bash
# Check web server running
curl http://localhost:5175

# Open in browser
open http://localhost:5175/tracker
open http://localhost:5175/inbox
```text

### Integration Testing

```bash
# Run backend tests
docker compose exec api python -m tests.test_applications

# Run small backfill (if Gmail connected)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8003/gmail/backfill?days=7"

# Check applications created
curl http://localhost:8003/applications | jq 'length'

# Check ES index has new fields (after backfill)
curl "http://localhost:9200/gmail_emails/_mapping" | jq '.gmail_emails.mappings.properties | {company, role, source, source_confidence}'
```text

## 🔍 Debugging Tips

### If applications aren't created during backfill

1. Check email extraction: Look at `emails` table, verify `company` and `role` columns populated
2. Check logs: `docker compose logs api --tail=50`
3. Run extraction manually: Use test functions to debug regex patterns
4. Check thread_id: Emails need thread_id OR company+role to group

### If "Create Application" button doesn't work

1. Check console errors: Open browser dev tools
2. Verify email has `company`: EmailCard only shows button if `e.company` exists
3. Check API response: `/gmail/inbox` should include `company`, `role`, `source`
4. Test endpoint: `curl -X POST http://localhost:8003/applications/from-email/1`

### If tracker page is empty

1. Check applications exist: `curl http://localhost:8003/applications`
2. Check filters: Try clicking "Clear Filters"
3. Check browser console: Look for fetch errors
4. Verify API running: `curl http://localhost:8003/health`

### If status updates don't save

1. Check network tab: See if PATCH request succeeds
2. Check API logs: `docker compose logs api --tail=20`
3. Test directly: `curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8003/applications/1 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"status":"interview"}'`
4. Check permissions: Verify no foreign key constraint errors
