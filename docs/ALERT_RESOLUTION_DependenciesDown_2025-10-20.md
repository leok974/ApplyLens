# Alert Resolution: DependenciesDown

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Alert Name:** DependenciesDown  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Status:** ✅ Resolved

---

## Alert Details

**Alert Expression:**
```promql
(min(applylens_db_up) == 0) or (min(applylens_es_up) == 0)
```

**For Duration:** 2 minutes  
**Labels:** severity=critical  
**First Fired:** 2025-10-20T23:08:45Z

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Health Metrics Not Being Updated
The Prometheus metrics `applylens_db_up` and `applylens_es_up` were stuck at `0.0` even though the database and Elasticsearch containers were healthy and running.

**Why:**
- The health metrics are only updated when the `/ready` endpoint is called
- Docker Compose health check was calling `/healthz` instead of `/ready`
- `/healthz` is a simple liveness check that doesn't verify dependencies
- `/ready` is the readiness check that tests DB and ES connectivity and updates metrics

### Issue 2: Database Password Mismatch
Once metrics started being updated, the database health check revealed authentication failures.

**Why:**
- The PostgreSQL database was initialized with a different password than what's in `.env`
- The API was attempting to connect with `postgres:postgres`
- The database was expecting a different password from initial setup
- This caused all connection attempts to fail with `password authentication failed`

---

## Fix Applied

### Fix 1: Update Docker Health Check (Permanent)
**File:** `docker-compose.prod.yml`

**Before:**
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD-SHELL", "curl -f http://localhost:8003/healthz || exit 1"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
  start_period: 40s
```

**After:**
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD-SHELL", "curl -f http://localhost:8003/ready || exit 1"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
  start_period: 40s
```

**Impact:**
- Health check now runs every 30 seconds
- Each health check updates `applylens_db_up` and `applylens_es_up` metrics
- Prometheus can accurately monitor dependency health
- Alerts fire correctly when dependencies are actually down

### Fix 2: Reset Database Password (One-time)
**Command:**
```bash
docker exec applylens-db-prod psql -U postgres -d postgres \
  -c "ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'postgres';"
```

**Impact:**
- Password now matches what's in `.env` file
- API can connect to database successfully
- `applylens_db_up` metric shows `1.0` (healthy)

### Fix 3: Restart API Container
**Command:**
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d api
```

**Impact:**
- New health check configuration applied
- Container starts with correct endpoint monitoring
- Metrics begin updating automatically

## Verification

### Before Fix
```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8003/metrics | grep "_up"
applylens_db_up 0.0
applylens_es_up 0.0
```

### After Fix
```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8003/metrics | grep "_up"
applylens_db_up 1.0
applylens_es_up 1.0
```

### Readiness Check
```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8003/ready | jq
{
  "status": "ready",
  "db": "ok",
  "es": "ok",
  "migration": "0031_merge_heads"
}
```

### Alert Status
- **Before:** firing (value=0, both metrics down)
- **After:** pending (value=0, condition no longer met)
- **Expected:** Will resolve after 2-minute "for" duration

| 23:19:20 UTC | Changed healthcheck endpoint in docker-compose.prod.yml |
| 23:19:32 UTC | Restarted API container |
| 23:20:06 UTC | Identified database password authentication failures |
| 23:20:47 UTC | Reset postgres user password |
| 23:21:00 UTC | Verified /ready endpoint returns "ok" for both dependencies |
| 23:21:20 UTC | Confirmed metrics updated: db_up=1.0, es_up=1.0 |
| 23:21:45 UTC | Alert transitioned to "pending" state |
| 23:23:45 UTC | Expected alert full resolution (after 2-min "for" duration)

## Prevention

### 1. Database Password Management
**Problem:** Database password can get out of sync during development/resets.

**Solution:**
- Document the database password reset procedure
- Consider using Docker secrets for production
- Add database credential validation to pre-deploy checks

### 2. Health Check Endpoint Selection
**Problem:** Using wrong health check endpoint can hide dependency issues.

**Solution:**
- Document difference between `/healthz` (liveness) and `/ready` (readiness)
- Always use `/ready` for dependency monitoring
- Use `/healthz` only for basic "is the app running" checks

### 3. Metric Validation
**Problem:** Metrics can appear to be exposed but not actually update.

**Solution:**
- Add smoke test to verify metrics are changing
- Monitor metric staleness (time since last update)
- Alert on metrics that never change from initial value

## Related Configuration

### Endpoints
- **Liveness:** `GET /healthz` - Simple alive check (no dependencies)
- **Readiness:** `GET /ready` - Full readiness check (DB, ES, migrations)
- **Metrics:** `GET /metrics` - Prometheus metrics export

### Metrics
```python
# File: services/api/app/metrics.py
DB_UP = Gauge("applylens_db_up", "Database ping successful (1=up, 0=down)")
ES_UP = Gauge("applylens_es_up", "Elasticsearch ping successful (1=up, 0=down)")
```

### Alert Rules
```yaml
# File: infra/prometheus/alerts.yml
- alert: DependenciesDown
  expr: (min(applylens_db_up) == 0) or (min(applylens_es_up) == 0)
  for: 2m
  labels:
    severity: critical
  annotations:
    summary: "DB/ES not ready"
    description: "Either DB or Elasticsearch reports down"
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Health checks must update metrics** - Using `/healthz` for Docker health checks left metrics stale
2. **Database credentials must match** - Password mismatches cause silent failures until health checks run
3. **Test after changes** - Always verify metrics are updating after configuration changes
4. **Document initialization** - Database initialization with specific passwords should be documented
