# Phase Implementation Snapshots Archive

**Archived Date**: November 25, 2025
**Reason**: These are historical point-in-time snapshots of feature implementations.

---

## What's in this archive

Documentation files that captured the state of the system during various development phases:
- `PHASE_*_IMPLEMENTATION_*.md` - Implementation status snapshots
- `*_COMPLETE.md` - Feature completion milestones
- `NEXT_STEPS_*.md` - Historical roadmaps (if superseded)

---

## Why archived

These documents provided value during active development but are now:
- **Historical record** - Useful for understanding project evolution
- **Superseded** - Current architecture docs are authoritative
- **Point-in-time** - No longer reflect current state

---

## Current Documentation

For current system architecture and features, see:
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Current canonical architecture
- `docs/PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Current deployment guide
- Feature-specific docs in `/docs` (not archived)
