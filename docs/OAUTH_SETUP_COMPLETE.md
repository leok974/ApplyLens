- ✅ Redirect URI: `http://localhost:8003/auth/google/callback`

### Configuration

- ✅ `.env` file updated with:
  - GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS=/secrets/google.json
  - OAUTH_STATE_SECRET (random 64-char string)
  - OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=<http://localhost:8003/auth/google/callback>
  - Correct API_PORT=8003

### Services

- ✅ Secrets mounted at `/secrets` in API container
- ✅ Database migration completed
- ✅ API accessible at <http://localhost:8003>

## 🔐 OAuth Authentication Steps

### You should now see

1. Browser opened to Google OAuth consent screen
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Grant permissions for:
   - Read Gmail messages
   - View email address
4. Redirected back to <http://localhost:8003/auth/google/callback>
5. See success message or redirect to web app

### After Authentication

Check connection status:

```powershell
curl http://localhost:8003/gmail/status
```

Should return:

```json
{
  "connected": true,
  "user_email": "your-email@gmail.com",
  "provider": "google",
  "has_refresh_token": true,
  "total": 0
}
```

## 📧 Next Steps: Backfill Emails

### 1. Small Test (7 days)

```powershell
curl -Method POST "http://localhost:8003/gmail/backfill?days=7"
```

This will:

- Fetch emails from last 7 days
- Extract company, role, source from each
- Create Application records automatically
- Link emails to applications
- Index in Elasticsearch

Expected output:

```json
{
  "inserted": 50,
  "days": 7,
  "user_email": "your-email@gmail.com"
}
```

### 2. Check Applications Created

```powershell
curl http://localhost:8003/applications | ConvertFrom-Json | Format-Table company, role, status, source
```

### 3. View in UI

```powershell
start http://localhost:5175/inbox
start http://localhost:5175/tracker
```

**Inbox** (<http://localhost:5175/inbox>):

- See all your emails
- Company/role extracted and displayed
- Click "Create Application" button on emails
- Click "View Application" on linked emails

**Tracker** (<http://localhost:5175/tracker>):

- See all job applications
- Filter by status (applied, interview, offer, etc.)
- Search by company
- Update status via dropdown
- View details by clicking rows

## 🧪 Test Commands

### Check Connection

```powershell
# Status check
curl http://localhost:8003/gmail/status | ConvertFrom-Json

# List emails
curl http://localhost:8003/gmail/inbox?limit=10 | ConvertFrom-Json

# List applications
curl http://localhost:8003/applications | ConvertFrom-Json
```

### Search Examples

```powershell
# Search for "interview"
curl "http://localhost:8003/search?q=interview" | ConvertFrom-Json

# Search by company
curl "http://localhost:8003/search?q=engineer&company=Google" | ConvertFrom-Json

# Search by source
curl "http://localhost:8003/search?q=application&source=lever" | ConvertFrom-Json
```

### Full Backfill (60 days)

```powershell
# This may take 30-60 seconds for 100-200 emails
curl -Method POST "http://localhost:8003/gmail/backfill?days=60"
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If OAuth fails

```powershell
# Check API logs
docker compose -f D:\ApplyLens\infra\docker-compose.yml logs api --tail=50

# Restart API
docker compose -f D:\ApplyLens\infra\docker-compose.yml restart api

# Try OAuth again
start http://localhost:8003/auth/google/login
```

### If credentials not found

```powershell
# Verify file exists in container
docker compose -f D:\ApplyLens\infra\docker-compose.yml exec api ls -la /secrets/

# Check .env configuration
Get-Content D:\ApplyLens\infra\.env | Select-String "GOOGLE"
```

### If backfill fails

```powershell
# Check if authenticated
curl http://localhost:8003/gmail/status

# Check API logs for errors
docker compose -f D:\ApplyLens\infra\docker-compose.yml logs api --tail=100 | Select-String "error"
```

### Reset ES index (if needed)

```powershell
# Delete index to recreate with new mappings
curl -Method DELETE http://localhost:9200/gmail_emails

# Next backfill will recreate it automatically
```

## 📊 What to Expect

### After 7-day backfill

- **~20-50 emails** imported (varies by inbox activity)
- **~5-15 applications** created (based on job-related emails)
- **Companies detected**: ~70% accuracy
- **Roles detected**: ~60% accuracy  
- **ATS sources**: ~90% for Lever/Greenhouse/Workday

### Application Status Auto-Detection

- Contains "interview" → status = `interview`
- Contains "offer" → status = `offer` (if detected)
- Contains "rejection" → status = `rejected`
- Default → status = `applied`

### Email Grouping

- Emails with same `thread_id` → linked to same application
- Emails with same `company + role` → linked to same application
- Creates new application if no match found
