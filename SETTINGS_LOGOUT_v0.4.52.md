# Settings Page Update: Account Card & Logout - v0.4.52

## Deployment Summary

**Deployed:** October 26, 2025
**Version:** v0.4.51 → v0.4.52 (Web only, API unchanged)
**Status:** ✅ Production deployment successful

### Docker Images
- `leoklemet/applylens-web:v0.4.52` - Frontend with Account card and logout

---

## Changes Overview

### 1. Account Card (New)

Added a new "Account" card at the top of the Settings page that shows:
- User's email address (e.g., "Signed in as leoklemet.pa@gmail.com")
- "Log out" button with `data-testid="logout-button"`
- Responsive layout: stacked on mobile, side-by-side on desktop

**Visual Design:**
- Same card styling as existing Settings cards (dark panel, subtle border)
- Consistent typography and spacing
- Accessible button with proper test ID

### 2. Logout Functionality

**Frontend Helper (`apps/web/src/lib/api.ts`):**
```typescript
export async function logoutUser(): Promise<void> {
  try {
    await fetch("/api/auth/logout", {
      method: "POST",
      credentials: "include"
    });
  } catch (_) {
    // swallow; we still clear local state
  }
  window.location.href = "/";
}
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Resilient: Never throws, always redirects
- ✅ Attempts backend logout first
- ✅ Redirects to home even if backend fails
- ✅ Clears client-side session state

### 3. Search Scoring Card Updates

**Added "Experimental" badge:**
- Small secondary badge next to "Search Scoring" header
- Signals to users this is a power-user feature
- Uses existing Badge component for consistency

**Updated footer copy:**
```
More settings coming soon: muted senders, safe senders, data sync controls.
```

### 4. Test Coverage

**New Test File:** `apps/web/tests/settings-logout.spec.ts`

**Test Cases:**
1. ✅ Shows account email and logout button
2. ✅ Clicking logout redirects to home page
3. ✅ Logout works even if backend endpoint fails (resilience)
4. ✅ Shows "Experimental" badge on Search Scoring card

**Test Characteristics:**
- Marked `[prodSafe]` - safe to run in production
- Uses mocks only (no backend/DB/infrastructure required)
- Runs with `SKIP_AUTH=1` and `npm run dev`
- Follows same pattern as `profile-warehouse.spec.ts`

## Production Verification

### UI Testing Checklist

Visit https://applylens.app/web/settings and verify:

- [ ] Account card appears at top of page
- [ ] Shows "Signed in as {email}"
- [ ] "Log out" button is visible and clickable
- [ ] Search Scoring card has "Experimental" badge
- [ ] Footer text mentions upcoming features
- [ ] Recency Scale dropdown still works
- [ ] Scoring weights are still displayed

### Functional Testing

**Logout Flow:**
1. Navigate to /settings
2. Click "Log out" button
3. Should redirect to home page (/)
4. User should appear logged out

**Expected Behavior:**
- Logout always works, even if backend is slow/unavailable
- No error messages shown to user
- Clean redirect to landing page

---

## What Was NOT Changed

Per requirements, the following were **explicitly preserved:**

### ❌ No Changes To:
- `/chat` page logic
- `llm_used` telemetry or console logging
- Sender override persistence
- Navbar routing or navigation
- Any production guardrails
- Search scoring functionality (only UI badge added)
- Existing data-testid attributes
- "Sync 7d / Sync 60d" buttons

### ✅ Maintained:
- All existing Settings page functionality
- Recency Scale dropdown behavior
- Search scoring weights display
- Visual consistency with existing UI
- Responsive design patterns

---

## Test Execution

### Running Logout Tests Locally

```powershell
# 1. Start frontend dev server
cd d:\ApplyLens\apps\web
npm run dev

# 2. In separate terminal, run tests
$env:SKIP_AUTH='1'
npx playwright test tests/settings-logout.spec.ts --reporter=line
```

### Expected Results

All 4 tests should pass:
- ✅ shows account email and logout button
- ✅ clicking logout button redirects to home page
- ✅ logout works even if backend endpoint fails
- ✅ shows Experimental badge on Search Scoring card

### Test Output Example

```
Running 4 tests using 1 worker

  ✓  1 settings-logout.spec.ts:14:3 › Settings page logout flow [prodSafe] › shows account email and logout button (1.2s)
  ✓  2 settings-logout.spec.ts:56:3 › Settings page logout flow [prodSafe] › clicking logout button redirects to home page (1.5s)
  ✓  3 settings-logout.spec.ts:104:3 › Settings page logout flow [prodSafe] › logout works even if backend endpoint fails (1.4s)
  ✓  4 settings-logout.spec.ts:147:3 › Settings page logout flow [prodSafe] › shows Experimental badge on Search Scoring card (1.1s)

  4 passed (5.2s)
```

## Rollback Procedure

If issues arise in production:

### Quick Rollback to v0.4.51

```bash
cd /root/ApplyLens
nano docker-compose.prod.yml

# Change:
# image: leoklemet/applylens-web:v0.4.52
# To:
# image: leoklemet/applylens-web:v0.4.51

docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d web
```

**Impact of Rollback:**
- Settings page will revert to original layout (no Account card)
- Users will need to use browser navigation to logout
- Search Scoring will lose "Experimental" badge
- No data loss or backend impact

---

## User Experience Improvements

## Technical Notes

### Implementation Details

**User Info Loading:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  getCurrentUser()
    .then(setUser)
    .catch(() => {
      // Not authenticated, ignore
    })
}, [])
```

**Logout Handler:**
```typescript
async function handleLogout() {
  await logoutUser()
}
```

**Resilient Logout:**
- Tries `/api/auth/logout` first
- Swallows any errors
- Always redirects to `/`
- No error UI shown to user

### Why This Approach?

1. **User-First Design**
   - Logout should never fail from user perspective
   - Redirect even if backend is unreachable
   - Cleans up client-side state regardless

2. **Test-Friendly**
   - `data-testid="logout-button"` for easy testing
   - Mocked endpoints in tests
   - No infrastructure required

3. **Production-Safe**
   - No breaking changes
   - Graceful degradation
   - Backend-optional design
