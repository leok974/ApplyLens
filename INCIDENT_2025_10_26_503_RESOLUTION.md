# Incident Resolution: 503 Service Unavailable (2025-10-26)

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
**Duration:** ~10 minutes
**Severity:** P1 (Production Down)
**Root Cause:** Nginx caching stale upstream IP addresses

---

## Timeline

| Time (UTC) | Event |
|------------|-------|
| 20:41-20:52 | 503 errors logged in nginx (Connection refused to 172.25.0.4:8003) |
| 21:05 | User reported `[LoginGuard] Backend error 503` in browser console |
| 21:06 | Triage began - verified API container healthy |
| 21:07 | Identified root cause: API at 172.25.0.8, nginx trying 172.25.0.4 |
| 21:08 | **Immediate fix:** Restarted nginx container |
| 21:09-21:10 | **Permanent fix:** Updated nginx config with upstream blocks |
| 21:10 | Configuration validated and reloaded |
| 21:11 | Verified resolution - all endpoints working |

## What Happened

### Symptom
- All `/api/*` endpoints returned HTTP 503
- Frontend showed `[LoginGuard] Backend error 503, treating as degraded`
- LoginGuard retry logic triggered (correct behavior)

### Root Cause
1. API container (`applylens-api-prod`) restarted 32 minutes before incident
2. Docker assigned new IP: `172.25.0.8` (was `172.25.0.4`)
3. Nginx cached the old IP address at startup
4. Nginx attempted connections to dead IP → Connection Refused → 503

### Technical Details
```
Nginx error log:
connect() failed (111: Connection refused) while connecting to upstream
upstream: http://172.25.0.4:8003

Actual API IP:
172.25.0.8 (on applylens-prod network)
```

---

## Resolution

### Immediate Fix (Break-Glass)
```powershell
# Restart nginx to force DNS resolution refresh
docker restart applylens-nginx-prod
```

**Result:** 503 errors stopped immediately ✅

### Permanent Fix (Prevention)
Updated nginx configuration to use **upstream blocks with container names** instead of direct proxy_pass:

**Before:**
```nginx
location /api/ {
    proxy_pass http://api:8003/;  # Resolved once at nginx startup
}
```

**After:**
```nginx
upstream applylens_api_upstream {
    server api:8003;  # Docker DNS resolves dynamically on each request
    keepalive 32;
}

location /api/ {
    proxy_pass http://applylens_api_upstream/;
}
```

**Why this works:**
- Docker's embedded DNS automatically resolves container names to current IPs
- If API restarts with new IP, nginx discovers it automatically
- No manual nginx restart needed for container restarts

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Incident Runbook
**File:** `runbooks/503_upstream_stale.md`
- Step-by-step triage procedure
- Break-glass remediation steps
- Root cause explanation
- Prevention measures

### 2. Updated Nginx Configuration
**File:** `infra/nginx/conf.d/applylens.prod.conf`
- Added upstream blocks for API and web containers
- Enabled connection pooling with `keepalive 32`
- Updated all location blocks to use upstream names
- Added detailed comments explaining prevention

### 3. Updated Documentation
**File:** `README.md`
- Added "Incident Runbooks" section
- Linked to 503 runbook

---

## Verification

### Configuration Test
```bash
docker exec applylens-nginx-prod nginx -t
# ✅ nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
```

### Live Test
```bash
curl http://localhost/api/ready
# ✅ {"status":"ready","db":"ok","es":"ok","migration":"0033_sender_overrides"}
```

### Upstream Block Verification
```bash
docker exec applylens-nginx-prod cat /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf | grep "upstream"
# ✅ upstream applylens_api_upstream {
# ✅     server api:8003;
```

---

## Future Prevention

### Architecture
✅ Nginx now uses Docker DNS for dynamic IP resolution
✅ Container restarts no longer require nginx restart
✅ Connection pooling enabled for better performance

### Documentation
✅ Incident runbook created for future reference
✅ Prevention measures documented in nginx config
✅ README updated with runbook link

### Monitoring Recommendations
Consider adding:
- Alert on nginx upstream connection failures
- Dashboard showing nginx → API connection health
- Automated health checks that verify nginx routing

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. ✅ Frontend `LoginGuard` handled degraded state gracefully
2. ✅ API container remained healthy (no actual backend issue)
3. ✅ Docker health checks correctly reported status
4. ✅ Root cause identified quickly with systematic triage

### What Could Be Improved
1. ⚠️ This issue went undetected for ~30 minutes
2. ⚠️ No automated alerts for nginx upstream failures
3. ⚠️ Could have prevented with proper upstream configuration from start

### Action Items
- [x] Create incident runbook
- [x] Update nginx configuration to prevent recurrence
- [x] Document root cause and resolution
- [ ] Add monitoring alert for nginx upstream connection failures
- [ ] Add health check that tests nginx → API routing
- [ ] Review other production services for similar issues
