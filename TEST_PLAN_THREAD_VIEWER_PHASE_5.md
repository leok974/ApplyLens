# Test Plan: ThreadViewer Phase 5 ‚Äî Timeline + Rolling Summary + Feedback

**Phase:** 5
**Date:** October 27, 2025
**Branch:** `thread-viewer-v1`
**Goal:** Verify that AI-generated summary, timeline, and feedback controls render correctly and provide 10-second comprehension of thread context.

---

## Overview

Phase 5 adds two new contextual sections to ThreadViewer:
1. **ThreadSummarySection**: AI-generated headline + bullet points with "Helpful? Yes/No" feedback
2. **ConversationTimelineSection**: Chronological timeline of key events with visual badges

Both sections are designed for quick context ("I can understand this thread in 10 seconds without scrolling 40 quoted replies"). They render between RiskAnalysisSection and the full message body.

## Known Limitations / Future Work

1. **No persistence**: Feedback button state resets on drawer close (expected for Phase 5)
2. **Mock data**: Backend doesn't yet generate real summaries/timelines (fallback in place)
3. **No analytics POST**: Feedback doesn't send to backend yet (TODO for Phase 6)
4. **Static timeline**: No real-time updates as thread changes (future enhancement)
5. **No timeline filtering**: Shows all events, no ability to filter by kind (future)
