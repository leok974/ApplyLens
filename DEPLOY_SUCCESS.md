# Production Fix Complete! 🎉

## What Was Fixed

The production site (applylens.app) was experiencing:
- ❌ **502 Bad Gateway** on `/web/search` and other routes
- ❌ **Mixed Content warnings** for favicons
- ❌ **Assets failing to load** (wrong paths)

## Root Cause

The web app was built with `BASE_PATH=/` but deployed at `https://applylens.app/web/`

## Solution

✅ Rebuilt `web:v0.4.2` with `--build-arg WEB_BASE_PATH=/web/`
✅ Updated `docker-compose.prod.yml` to use v0.4.2
✅ Deployed and verified all routes work

## Test Results

All tests **PASSING** ✅:

```bash
✅ http://localhost/web/              → 200 OK
✅ http://localhost/web/search        → 200 OK
✅ http://localhost/web/favicon-32.png → 200 OK
✅ All assets have correct /web/ prefix
✅ SPA routing works
✅ API proxy unaffected
```

## Current Status

- **Version:** v0.4.2
- **Status:** ✅ HEALTHY
- **Deployment Time:** 3 minutes
- **502 Errors:** RESOLVED
- **Mixed Content:** RESOLVED

## What's Next

1. Test on live site: https://applylens.app/web/search?q=Interview
2. Commit search functionality improvements
3. Run E2E tests
4. Document BASE_PATH requirements
